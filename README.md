# Creating a Blockchain Testnet

### Step 1: Creating The Genesis Block
#### In order to create the Genesis Block, we had to use the Puppeth wizard from GETH. Running through the steps and prompts, we were able to get to the most important step...Choosing a name for your network. Because I happened to be listening to Bad Bunny at the time, I decided to name my network "badbunnynet"...

### Step 2: Creating Both Nodes
#### Without nodes, this networkk would be pointless. In order to activate the blockchain, we have to create a minimum of two nodes. Following the prompts, we were able to create Node 1 & Node 2: ./geth account new --datadir node1
